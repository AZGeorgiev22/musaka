The first primitive forms of robots emerged in the 20th century and were primarily mechanical devices designed to perform simple tasks. These early robots had limited capabilities and were mainly used in industrial processes such as factories and manufacturing.

            With the development of computers and information technology, robotics started to advance significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, the first programmable robots appeared, capable of performing more complex tasks and being modified according to needs. During this time, robots were primarily used in industry to automate production processes.</p></div>
